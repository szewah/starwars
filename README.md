## Starwars Game RPG

Built with: HTML, CSS, Jquery

## Here's how the app works:

The user selects a fighter and an opponent from the remaining characters in no particular order. When the fighter hits the opponent, their attack value grows. Likewise when the fighter is hit, their health value decreases. The fighter wins when all the opponents are destroyed.
